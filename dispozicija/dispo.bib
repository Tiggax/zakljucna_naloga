abstract={There has been a rapid increase in the number and demand for approved biopharmaceuticals produced from animal cell culture processes over the last few years. In part, this has been due to the efficacy of several humanized monoclonal antibodies that are required at large doses for therapeutic use. There have also been several identifiable advances in animal cell technology that has enabled efficient biomanufacture of these products. Gene vector systems allow high specific protein expression and some minimize the undesirable process of gene silencing that may occur in prolonged culture. Characterization of cellular metabolism and physiology has enabled the design of fed-batch and perfusion bioreactor processes that has allowed a significant improvement in product yield, some of which are now approaching 5 g/L. Many of these processes are now being designed in serum-free and animal-component-free media to ensure that products are not contaminated with the adventitious agents found in bovine serum. There are several areas that can be identified that could lead to further improvement in cell culture systems. This includes the down-regulation of apoptosis to enable prolonged cell survival under potentially adverse conditions. The characterization of the critical parameters of glycosylation should enable process control to reduce the heterogeneity of glycoforms so that production processes are consistent. Further improvement may also be made by the identification of glycoforms with enhanced biological activity to enhance clinical efficacy. The ability to produce the ever-increasing number of biopharmaceuticals by animal cell culture is dependent on sufficient bioreactor capacity in the industry. A recent shortfall in available worldwide culture capacity has encouraged commercial activity in contract manufacturing operations. However, some analysts indicate that this still may not be enough and that future manufacturing demand may exceed production capacity as the number of approved biotherapeutics increases.},

Quantitative modeling integrates both kinetics for some key reaction steps and optimization-driven metabolic flux allocation, using flux balance analysis; this is known to lead to certain mathematical inconsistencies. Here, we propose a physically-informed data-driven hybrid model (a "gray box") to learn models of the dynamical evolution of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell bioreactors from process data. The approach incorporates physical laws (e.g. mass balances) as well as kinetic expressions for metabolic fluxes. Machine learning (ML) is then used to (a) directly learn evolution equations (black-box modelling); (b) recover unknown physical parameters ("white-box" parameter fitting) or -- importantly -- (c) learn partially unknown kinetic expressions (gray-box modelling). We encode the convex optimization step of the overdetermined metabolic biophysical system as a differentiable, feed-forward layer into our architectures, connecting partial physical knowledge with data-driven machine learning.}}

To improve comparability between bioreactor studies and shake flask studies, shake flask studies should be conducted as fed-batch. However, the smaller volumes and reduced control in shake flasks can impact pH and aeration, which leads to performance differences. Planning and awareness of these vessel and control differences can assist with experimental design as well as troubleshooting. This method will highlight several of the configuration and control issues that should be considered during the transitions from batch to fed-batch and shake flasks to bioreactors, as well as approaches to mitigate the differences. Furthermore, if significant differences occur between bioreactor and shake flask studies, approaches will be presented to isolate the main contributors for these differences.}}

Viable cell concentration (VCC) is one of the most important key performance indicator (KPI) during mammalian cell cultivation processes. Commonly, this is measured offline. In this work, we demonstrated the comparability and scalability of linear regression models derived from online capacitance measurements. The linear regressions were used to predict the VCC and other familiar offline biomass indicators, like the viable cell volume (VCV) and the wet cell weight (WCW), in two different industrially relevant CHO cell culture processes (Process A and Process B). Therefore, different single-use bioreactor scales (50–2000 L) were used to prove feasibility and scalability of the in-line sensor integration. Coefficient of determinations of 0.79 for Process A and 0.99 for Process B for the WCW were achieved. The VCV was described with high coefficients of determination of 0.96 (Process A) and 0.98 (Process B), respectively. In agreement with other work from the literature, the VCC was only described within the exponential growth phase, but resulting in excellent coefficients of determination of 0.99 (Process A) and 0.96 (Process B), respectively. Monitoring these KPIs online using linear regression models appeared to be scale-independent, enabled deeper process understanding (e.g. here demonstrated in monitoring, the feeding profile) and showed the potential of this method for process control.}}

The kinetic model consists of six differential equations, which describe dynamics of viable cell density and concentrations of glucose, glutamine, ammonia, lactate, and the antibody fusion protein B1 (B1). The kinetic model has 18 parameters, six of which were calculated from the cell culture data, whereas the other 12 were estimated from a training data set that comprised of seven cell culture runs using a MCMC method. The model was confirmed in two validation data sets that represented a perturbation of the cell culture condition. The agreement between the predicted and measured values of both validation data sets may indicate high reliability of the model estimates. The kinetic model uniquely incorporated the ammonia removal and the exponential function of B1 protein concentration. The model indicated that ammonia and lactate play critical roles in cell growth and that low concentrations of glucose (0.17 mM) and glutamine (0.09 mM) in the cell culture medium may help reduce ammonia and lactate production. The model demonstrated that 83% of the glucose consumed was used for cell maintenance during the late phase of the cell cultures, whereas the maintenance coefficient for glutamine was negligible. Finally, the kinetic model suggests that it is critical for B1 production to sustain a high number of viable cells. The MCMC methodology may be a useful tool for modeling kinetics of a fed-batch mammalian cell culture process. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol. Prog., 2010}}

Current methods for measuring Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) such as glycation and glycosylation are time and resource intensive, often, only tested offline once per batch process. Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tools such as Raman Spectroscopy combined with Chemometric modelling can provide real time measurements process variables and are aligned with the QbD approach. This study utilises these tools to build Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression models to provide real time monitoring of glycation and glycosylation profiles. In total, 7 cell line specific chemometric PLS models; % mono-glycated, % non-glycated, % G0F-GlcNac, % G0, % G0F, % G1F and % G2F were considered. PLS models were initially developed using small scale data to verify the capability of Raman to measure these CQAs effectively. Accurate PLS model predictions were observed at small scale (5L). At manufacturing scale (2000L) some glycosylation models showed higher error, indicating that scale may be a key consideration in glycosylation profile PLS model development. Model robustness was then considered by supplementing models with a single batch of manufacturing scale data. This data addition had a significant impact on the predictive capability of each model, with an improvement of 77.5% in the case of the G2F. The finalised models show the capability of Raman as a PAT tool to deliver real time monitoring of glycation and glycosylation profiles at manufacturing scale. This article is protected by copyright.

To control and optimize the process, a model was established to closely combine the feeding and perfusion operation on a basis of step-by-step strategy. The culture process was divided into many consecutive sections in the time dimension, and the feeding and perfusion rates in each section were calculated with the data in the former sections. The feeding operation was controlled by a feeding model to supplement with exact nutrients, while the perfusion operation was controlled by a perfusion model to keep byproduct concentration at low level. Linking by glucose, lactate and ammonia concentrations, the two separate models were integrated to globally control the cell culture process. By using this control strategy, the toxic byproducts were kept below their inhibitory concentrations, and a viable cell density of 13 · 10 cells L and the HBsAg production of 1.65 mg L were achieved in controlled-fed perfusion mode, representing an almost two-fold increase over a perfusion culture.}}
