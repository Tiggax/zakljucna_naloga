Kevrekidis},doi={10.48550/arxiv.2305.03257},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={4376864988},journal={Computers &amp; Chemical Engineering},abstract={Fed-batch culture is an established operation mode for the production of biologics using mammalian cell cultures. Quantitative modeling integrates both kinetics for some key reaction steps and optimization-driven metabolic flux allocation, using flux balance analysis; this is known to lead to certain mathematical inconsistencies. Here, we propose a physically-informed data-driven hybrid model (a "gray box") to learn models of the dynamical evolution of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell bioreactors from process data. The approach incorporates physical laws (e.g. mass balances) as well as kinetic expressions for metabolic fluxes. Machine learning (ML) is then used to (a) directly learn evolution equations (black-box modelling); (b) recover unknown physical parameters ("white-box" parameter fitting) or -- importantly -- (c) learn partially unknown kinetic expressions (gray-box modelling). We encode the convex optimization step of the overdetermined metabolic biophysical system as a differentiable, feed-forward layer into our architectures, connecting partial physical knowledge with data-driven machine learning.}}

abstract={There has been a rapid increase in the number and demand for approved biopharmaceuticals produced from animal cell culture processes over the last few years. In part, this has been due to the efficacy of several humanized monoclonal antibodies that are required at large doses for therapeutic use. There have also been several identifiable advances in animal cell technology that has enabled efficient biomanufacture of these products. Gene vector systems allow high specific protein expression and some minimize the undesirable process of gene silencing that may occur in prolonged culture. Characterization of cellular metabolism and physiology has enabled the design of fed-batch and perfusion bioreactor processes that has allowed a significant improvement in product yield, some of which are now approaching 5 g/L. Many of these processes are now being designed in serum-free and animal-component-free media to ensure that products are not contaminated with the adventitious agents found in bovine serum. There are several areas that can be identified that could lead to further improvement in cell culture systems. This includes the down-regulation of apoptosis to enable prolonged cell survival under potentially adverse conditions. The characterization of the critical parameters of glycosylation should enable process control to reduce the heterogeneity of glycoforms so that production processes are consistent. Further improvement may also be made by the identification of glycoforms with enhanced biological activity to enhance clinical efficacy. The ability to produce the ever-increasing number of biopharmaceuticals by animal cell culture is dependent on sufficient bioreactor capacity in the industry. A recent shortfall in available worldwide culture capacity has encouraged commercial activity in contract manufacturing operations. However, some analysts indicate that this still may not be enough and that future manufacturing demand may exceed production capacity as the number of approved biotherapeutics increases.},

abstract={Industrial processes involving animal cells for the production of useful products still seem to be rather uncommon. Nevertheless, during the last four decades of the last century the number of relevant processes has increased from production of virus vaccines to monoclonal antibodies and finally complex structured glycoproteins. As soon as cell lines became permanent and culture medium changed from purely biological fluids to more or less defined chemical media, large-scale cultivation could begin. The developments of the 1970s -- fusion of cells to form hybridomas, and genetic engineering -- triggered a second wave of products. Monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins for diagnosis and therapy set new challenges for the inventors. Historically, there has been no straightforward process development since the product dictates the process operation. Therefore, the scale of production covers the whole range from small multiple-unit reactors (flasks or roller bottles) up to 10,000-l single-unit batch reactors. Products with high value and small demand can be produced in multiple-unit systems whereas "bulk" products for vaccination and therapy may need large-scale bioreactors to be cost effective. All the different systems have their advantages and disadvantages and significant challenges that curb the development of effective perfusion cultures still remain.},

Thus, the quality and efficacy of a protein can be superior when expressed in mammalian cells versus other hosts such as bacteria, plants and yeast. Recently, the productivity of mammalian cells cultivated in bioreactors has reached the gram per liter range in a number of cases, a more than 100-fold yield improvement over titers seen for similar processes in the mid-1980s. This increase in volumetric productivity has resulted mainly from improvements in media composition and process control. Opportunities still exist for improving mammalian cell systems through further advancements in production systems as well as through vector and host cell engineering.}}

This achievement is associated with progression in the establishment of high and stable producer and the optimization of culture process including media development. In this review article, we focus on current strategies and achievements in cell line development, mainly in vector engineering and cell engineering, for high and stable protein production in rCHO cells. The approaches that manipulate various DNA elements for gene targeting by site-specific integration and cis-acting elements to augment and stabilize gene expression are reviewed here. The genetic modulation strategy by “direct” cell engineering with growth-promoting and/or productivity-enhancing factors and omics-based approaches involved in transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to pursue cell engineering are also presented.}}

Yap and Miranda G S Yap},doi={null},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={2522830001},journal={Chemical Engineering Progress},abstract={Recombinant protein therapeutics have changed the face of modern medicine in the past decade, and they continue to provide innovative and effective therapies for numerous previously refractory illnesses. Today, they are used in the treatment of a variety of human diseases, ranging from cancers to infertility. These proteins are generally synthesized by large-scale cultivation of genetically engineered “host” cells, which harbor artificially transfected genes encoding for the proteins of interest. For protein therapeutics to be effective, they must be synthesized in biologically active forms, requiring proper folding and post-translational modifications. In many cases, this includes glycosylation, a type of modification where certain carbohydrate moieties are added to specific amino acid residues of the protein. Glycoproteins, as these are usually called, are generally synthesized in mammalian cells, because common microbial hosts like Escherichia coli lack the requisite machinery to synthesize appropriate glycoforms. Several rodentor human-derived cells like 3T3, CHO, BHK, HeLa and HepG2 are frequently used in biomedical research for heterologous protein expression. Despite the availability of a plenitude of cell lines, nearly 70% of all recombinant protein therapeutics produced today are made in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The current annual sales for biologics produced using CHO cells alone exceed US\$30 billion worldwide. The first recombinant therapeutic protein produced in mammalian cells, tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA, Activase) synthesized using CHO cells, was approved for clinical use in 1987. This marked the beginning of an array of highly successful CHO-based therapeutics (Table), which continue to revolutionize the field of medicine to this day. The knowledge and expertise amassed over the past two decades will most certainly ensure that CHO cells continue to remain the industry's premier workhorse for therapeutic protein production, at least in the near future. In this article, we revisit the evolution of CHO cells, tracing from their origins to the development of current production cell lines, and discuss some important aspects that make them robust and versatile protein expression hosts. Unlike some of its rodent relatives (mouse and rat), the generation of genomic resources for Chinese hamster has been quite limited. Genomic and proteomic tools using these resources can potentially aid in understanding and improving recombinant protein production processes leading to a significant enhancement in the speed with which these therapeutics transition from laboratory molecules to life-saving medicines. We, therefore, devote special attention to the value and need for such information in meeting the challenges of future research and manufacturing processes.}}

However, the smaller volumes and reduced control in shake flasks can impact pH and aeration, which leads to performance differences. Planning and awareness of these vessel and control differences can assist with experimental design as well as troubleshooting. This method will highlight several of the configuration and control issues that should be considered during the transitions from batch to fed-batch and shake flasks to bioreactors, as well as approaches to mitigate the differences. Furthermore, if significant differences occur between bioreactor and shake flask studies, approaches will be presented to isolate the main contributors for these differences.}}

Viable cell concentration (VCC) is one of the most important key performance indicator (KPI) during mammalian cell cultivation processes. Commonly, this is measured offline. In this work, we demonstrated the comparability and scalability of linear regression models derived from online capacitance measurements. The linear regressions were used to predict the VCC and other familiar offline biomass indicators, like the viable cell volume (VCV) and the wet cell weight (WCW), in two different industrially relevant CHO cell culture processes (Process A and Process B). Therefore, different single-use bioreactor scales (50–2000 L) were used to prove feasibility and scalability of the in-line sensor integration. Coefficient of determinations of 0.79 for Process A and 0.99 for Process B for the WCW were achieved. The VCV was described with high coefficients of determination of 0.96 (Process A) and 0.98 (Process B), respectively. In agreement with other work from the literature, the VCC was only described within the exponential growth phase, but resulting in excellent coefficients of determination of 0.99 (Process A) and 0.96 (Process B), respectively. Monitoring these KPIs online using linear regression models appeared to be scale-independent, enabled deeper process understanding (e.g. here demonstrated in monitoring, the feeding profile) and showed the potential of this method for process control.}}

The kinetic model consists of six differential equations, which describe dynamics of viable cell density and concentrations of glucose, glutamine, ammonia, lactate, and the antibody fusion protein B1 (B1). The kinetic model has 18 parameters, six of which were calculated from the cell culture data, whereas the other 12 were estimated from a training data set that comprised of seven cell culture runs using a MCMC method. The model was confirmed in two validation data sets that represented a perturbation of the cell culture condition. The agreement between the predicted and measured values of both validation data sets may indicate high reliability of the model estimates. The kinetic model uniquely incorporated the ammonia removal and the exponential function of B1 protein concentration. The model indicated that ammonia and lactate play critical roles in cell growth and that low concentrations of glucose (0.17 mM) and glutamine (0.09 mM) in the cell culture medium may help reduce ammonia and lactate production. The model demonstrated that 83% of the glucose consumed was used for cell maintenance during the late phase of the cell cultures, whereas the maintenance coefficient for glutamine was negligible. Finally, the kinetic model suggests that it is critical for B1 production to sustain a high number of viable cells.

Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tools such as Raman Spectroscopy combined with Chemometric modelling can provide real time measurements process variables and are aligned with the QbD approach. This study utilises these tools to build Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression models to provide real time monitoring of glycation and glycosylation profiles. In total, 7 cell line specific chemometric PLS models; % mono-glycated, % non-glycated, % G0F-GlcNac, % G0, % G0F, % G1F and % G2F were considered. PLS models were initially developed using small scale data to verify the capability of Raman to measure these CQAs effectively. Accurate PLS model predictions were observed at small scale (5L). At manufacturing scale (2000L) some glycosylation models showed higher error, indicating that scale may be a key consideration in glycosylation profile PLS model development. Model robustness was then considered by supplementing models with a single batch of manufacturing scale data. This data addition had a significant impact on the predictive capability of each model, with an improvement of 77.5% in the case of the G2F. The finalised models show the capability of Raman as a PAT tool to deliver real time monitoring of glycation and glycosylation profiles at manufacturing scale. This article is protected by copyright.

To control and optimize the process, a model was established to closely combine the feeding and perfusion operation on a basis of step-by-step strategy. The culture process was divided into many consecutive sections in the time dimension, and the feeding and perfusion rates in each section were calculated with the data in the former sections. The feeding operation was controlled by a feeding model to supplement with exact nutrients, while the perfusion operation was controlled by a perfusion model to keep byproduct concentration at low level. Linking by glucose, lactate and ammonia concentrations, the two separate models were integrated to globally control the cell culture process. By using this control strategy, the toxic byproducts were kept below their inhibitory concentrations, and a viable cell density of 13 · 10 cells L and the HBsAg production of 1.65 mg L were achieved in controlled-fed perfusion mode, representing an almost two-fold increase over a perfusion culture.}}
