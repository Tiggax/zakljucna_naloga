Bioprocesses using @GMO[s] are widely used in todays production of pharmaceuticals.
It is an expensive undertaking in both time and resources needed to produce the wanted end products.
They require expensive bioreactors, cell lines and substrates to run.
Much research is invested into growing, studying and evaluating the optimum conditions of these cell lines, as well as research of optimal bioreactor and substrates.
Research of these cell lines is conducted on smaller scales, to keep costs to the minimum, but this opens up a new problem.
Cell lines that grow optimally on small scales do not necessarily scale linearly into large bioreactors needed for industrial production.
