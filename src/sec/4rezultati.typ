= Default system

Simulating the default system with variables seen in @constants, we get the following graph seen in @default and in @default-fac. 
Volume starts to rise with day 2, as at that time bioreactor feeding initiates. 
At day 3 a temperature shift has been made, that changes the growth rate of @VCD.
@DO levels drop from 80% to 25% within the first day, when the @PID controller started adding oxygen to keep the minimum level of 25%.
At around day 12, the @PID controller hits maximum output, and the @DO level starts dropping towards 0%.
@VCD concentration grows steadily, until that day when growth starts to fall off.
Glucose and glutamine are being used, but never at rate, that would cause the feed to supply too little for the cells to grow.

= Variations of the system

In @vcd, a graph of @VCD can be seen, graphing three different initial inoculations with inoculum of $0.4$, $0.5$ (default) and $0.6$.
All three inoculations had a temperature shift at day 3.
While $0.4$ inoculation steadily rises during the whole process, $0.5$ and $0.6$ inoculations start to stabilize at around day 12 and 11.
Both rise before stabilizing at a value of around $3.65$.
The value of around $3.65$ could be said to be the cell concentration capacity of the system.

)<vcd>

@vcd-fac shows the whole system for each of the values in relation to time.
It can be seen that glucose and glutamine levels drop more by the end of the process if the inoculation value is higher, while the @PID control uses more oxygen.
It can also be noted that the percentage of oxygen drops sooner in the end of the process, as the cells hit the capacity of the system.
The concentration of product extracted increases with the higher inoculation value.

In @mu_max it can be seen that changing the $mu_"max"$ constant changes the rate at which the cells multiply. 
This means that higher values translate to faster growth of cells in the same medium.
The cells grow faster, but the concentration limits towards the value of $3.65$.
This again could be speculated similarly to @vcd to be the capacity of the system.

)<mu_max>

Looking at other values in @mu_max-fac, it can be seen that higher values of $mu_"max"$ also accelerate the consumption of glucose, glutamine and oxygen.
As more cells are generated, the concentration of product also rises.
Bigger consumption also strains the @PID control, as more oxygen needs to be pumped into the system for cells to not suffocate.

Changing the feed rate results in the following @feed.
Red line represents a bioreactor with no feed.
It can be seen that as the feed rate increases the concentration is increases slower.
This could be attributed to a faster dilution of cells in the medium.

  image("/figures/feed.png")
)<feed>

In @feed-fac  we can see feed rate compared to other values.
Glucose and glutamine are similarly diluted like cell density.
It can be seen that the concentration of product remains relativly the same for all feed rates.

Graphing glucose in @glucose and @glucose-fac and glutamine in @glutamin and @glutamin-fac it can be seen, that glucose and glutamine constants mainly affect the consumption of glucose and glutamine, with no major changes in the system.

= Fitting to the Data

The system was approximated manually, to get close to data values , and then used the Nelder-Mead  algorithm to fit the @VCD.
