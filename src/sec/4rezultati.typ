= Default system

Simulating the default system with variables seen in @constants, we get the following graph seen in @default and in @default-fac. 
Volume starts to rise with day 2, as at that time bioreactor feeding initiates. 
At day 3 a temperature shift has been made, that changes the growth rate of @VCD.
@DO levels drop from 80% to 25% within the first day, when the @PID controller started adding oxygen to keep the minimum level of 25%.
At around day 12, the @PID controller hits maximum output, and the @DO level starts dropping towards 0%.
@VCD concentration grows steadily, until that day when growth starts to fall off.
Glucose and glutamine are being used, but never at rate, that would cause the feed to supply too little for the cells to grow.

= Variations of the system

In @vcd, a graph of @VCD can be seen, graphing three different initial inoculations with inoculum of $0.4$, $0.5$ (default) and $0.6$.
All three inoculations had a temperature shift at day 3.
While $0.4$ inoculation steadily rises during the whole process, $0.5$ and $0.6$ inoculations start to stabilize at around day 12 and 11.
Both rise before stabilizing at a value of around $3.65$.
#todo[write in discussion: The value of around $3.65$ could be said to be the cell concentration capacity of the system.]

@vcd-fac shows the whole system for each of the values in relation to time.
It can be seen that glucose and glutamine levels drop more by the end of the process if the inoculation value is higher, while the @PID control uses more oxygen.
It can also be noted that the percentage of oxygen drops sooner in the end of the process, as the cells hit the capacity of the system.
The concentration of product extracted increases with the higher inoculation value.
